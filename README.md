## My process
I needed a hand to hold to even start this. AS I am brand new to coding. I found a tutorial on YouTube to follow and start me off (hopefully) right. I have the link and the creator listed below under What I Learned.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I am still very very new to this, and needed a tutorial to follow as I created this first project. The tutolial I used is found here:

There are a few things I didn't understand as the tutorial went along, but I looked them up on MDN. 

The few items I still don't understand are:

Why the double underscore is needed with the bg__image.
When I removed it and just had it as bg-image, the wave on the left TOTALLY flattened out.

The main thing I am very frustrated with is the background image. When expanding the page to very wide, the wave on the left flattens out at 1075px. It is like the image WANTS to be larger, but the div it is in is set at 879x335, and I could not find a way to change this where it made a difference. 

This has taken up so much of my time to try and figure out. It is very CLEAR that I have much more to learn about what makes responsive websites, the HTML and the CSS too. 

Over all, I am pleased with how the main container looks.

What I changed from the tutorial:
I tweaked the size of the Proceed to Payment button, and the margin, the border-radius of the main container, and the Proceed button, the font weight and size of the text, specifically the h1. I didn't think the tutorial quite got those right.

### Continued development

I want to try this project again from ground zero. OR perhaps another "newbie" project. I seem to learn best by watching and then doing.
